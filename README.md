# Timetable Generator Project

This project consists of 3 files: an Excel file, a Python script, and an executable file.

## Files Included:
- `test.xlsm` (Excel file with macros)
- `scheduler.py` (Python script)
- `scheduler.exe` (Compiled executable)

## Steps to Use the Project

Follow these steps to set up and use the Timetable Generator:

### 1. **Download the Project**
   Download all the files included in the project and make sure they are stored in the **same directory**. For example, place both `test.xlsm` and `scheduler.exe` in your **Downloads** folder.

### 2. **Enable Macros for Excel**
   To ensure that macros work correctly in Excel, you need to enable them:

   1. Open Excel.
   2. Go to **File > Options**.
   3. Click on **Trust Center** in the left sidebar.
   4. Click on **Trust Center Settings**.
   5. Select **Macro Settings** from the options.
   6. Click on **Enable VBA macros**.

### 3. **Unlock the Sheets**
   Once the workbook is opened, you will need to unlock the sheets to make them editable:

   - Use the password **`1234`** to unprotect the sheets.

### 4. **Login to the Application**
   - Open the **Login Form** within the workbook.
   - Use the following credentials to log in:
     - **Username**: `admin`
     - **Password**: `admin123`

### 5. **Use the Main Menu**
   After logging in, the main menu will be displayed. From here, you can:

   - Choose the page where you want to **view**, **add**, or **edit** information.
   - Click on **Generate Timetable** after all the required information is added.

### 6. **Generate the Timetable**
   Once everything is set up, click the **Generate Timetable** button. The timetable will be generated based on the data you input.

   **Note**: The **Lecturer** columns in the timetable are left blank intentionally, so the admin can insert lecturers based on their expertise in certain subjects.

### 7. **Visualizations**
   After generating the timetable, you can view visualizations of the resource allocations in the **Visualization Sheet**. This will help you understand how the venues are utilized in the timetable.
