## Generate the Timetable 🕒

Once everything is set up, open the sheet and redirect to the main menu. Click the **Generate Timetable** button. The timetable will be generated based on the data you input.

**Note**: The **Lecturer** columns in the timetable are left blank intentionally, so the admin can insert lecturers based on their expertise in certain subjects.

**Credential**: 
1. The **Password** to unlock the sheet is 1234.
2. The **Username** for the login would be admin and **Password** would be 1234.

## Visualizations 📊

After generating the timetable, you can view visualizations of the resource allocations in the **Dashboard Sheet**. This will help you understand how the venues are utilized in the timetable.
